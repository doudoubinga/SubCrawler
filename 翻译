today so we are going to start C language C language so before going to

discuss about C language nothing but before going to learn one programming

language first of all the two basic questions that every programmer should

understand and of course we should answer so first one is a what is

language what is language and second one

what is computer language because we are going to learn a language so first of

all we should know what is a language and what is computer language so what is

the language means is a simple thing a language is nothing but a set of

instructions so generally if you take a English language you language Hindi

language so generally the languages we are using to communicate if you want to

communicate with another person we are passing instructions using a particular

language but while using a language we need to follow some of the instructions

some rules already they had given so what are the rules for example if I want

to speak in English I just want to form a sentence to form a sentence first we

should be good grammatically we know that generally or else we cannot form a

sentence we cannot speak in English language right in the same way so

computer language is also for communication sake only

is actually why computer language is to communicate with a computer but simply

if they ask what is a computer language it is also a set of instructions simply

set of programs set of programs so that will give an application application to

understand easily it's a software a

computer language is a software a computer language is a predefined

application right using computer language so what we will do so means we

will communicate with the system's right we will communicate with some other

electronic devices in this world so that is actually need of computer language

what is the need of computer language here need see just consider one person

is present generally in this world only one process is there that is called

communication right here it is I am teaching right nothing but I am

communicating with you people right if you want to ask any question any query

you want to pass then you should communicate with me right I am working

means what I am communicating with my bike I just want to travel from one

location to another location I am communicating with my mother

and I am communicating with my father some reasons are there the particular

purpose is there so communication means something you are getting right so if

one person you want to communicate with another person generally they have to

share information information is nothing but a passing

instructions for general communication they are using general languages like

English Telugu Hindi all these languages they will use all these languages but

now here the person want to communicate with the machine any electronic machine

this consider computer the person want to communicate with the machine sir

question wiser why the person want to communicate with the machine simple

thing just consider here it is I am asking the question what is the five

factorial everyone can answer easily it's a 120

all right it is a simple calculation right 120 suppose if my next question is

what is 120 factorial no one can answer no one because it's a bit complex

operation it's a bit complex operation so directly instantly we can tell if I

give some time to you so then within that time you can calculate and we will

but instead of performing complex operations manually it is better to

interact with the electronic device example take calcium so using calculator

whatever the number you give as an input fraction of seconds you will get

downloaded right so that is the complex operations it is better to perform

manually right so here but the problem is we need to pass instructions in

machine code only if I want to communicate with you I am teaching

something to you why I am using English language

because all you people understand English language very easily so that is

the only reason I am using English language in the same way if the person

want to communicate with the computer the person needs to pass instructions in

a machine code only in a computer understandable language only

so what computer understands binary language computer understands binary

language can anyone pass instructions in a binary language impossible we cannot

write applications right in a binary language it's very complex so that's why

first you have to learn one programming language properly right see using using

any programming language so many examples C C++ Java dotnet all these are

programming languages like high level languages first you have to learn one

programming language all the rules write how to define the instruction set how to

write a programs everything you should learn perfectly right so once you are

perfect in one programming language right you should be perfect why the

reason suppose if I am perfect in English language so then only I can

interact with you in English language in the same way if you want to communicate

with the computer using C language first you should learn perfectly C language

after learning language we are writing programs writing writing programs

right so programs means a set of instructions a equals to 10 B equals to

20 C equals to a plus B and just we are printing C it's a program a simple

program I have written addition of two numbers sir I don't know how to write

the program just leave it forget about it this is not the program just looking

like an English instruction set it's not a C language it's not C++ right so

programming language instructions looking like an English statements only

we are taking two variables nothing but two values and we are adding and

printing simple this is what we call the source code source code but once a

source code is ready nothing but once your program is ready using that program

directly we cannot communicate with the computer it will reject sir wise are

already program written using programming language yes but what all

the instructions you have written so that is in English language computer

cannot understand English computer understands only binary language that is

once and zeros only so then what we should do how can we convert that

English instruction set into binary language already they had given one

program for us the program name is called compiler program name is called

compiler this is a predefined program software that was already ready so we

should take care about the code that what you have written we are responsible

for conversion compilers all available so what compiler will do means

that converts all these instructions into binary language same instructions

will convert into binary language now machine code is ready so once machine

code is ready so that you can pass as an input to the computer so that computer

will produce the output this is actually the process of communication with the

computer directly we cannot communicate with the computer why we are

communicating means to perform complex operations in an easy way

imagine ATM facility is not available I just want to withdraw some amount of

money from my account how difficult it is right so it is a long process first I

have to visit the bank and then so much process I have to complete finally I

will get the money right suppose if availability machine availability is

there right within one minute or two minutes you will get wherever you are in

this world right you will get the money so machines always makes our task very

easy so that is the only reason we are communicating with the machines right so

what direct communication is not allowed because we cannot pass instructions in a

binary language so first we have to learn one language after learning the

language right we are writing programs and then converting into binary

instruction set using compiler and then communication so that is why after

writing the program's are why compilation is required this is the only

reason behind that so this

is why right we are using compiler what is an interface what is an interface for

example here the communication process we have already seen communication

process in some of the cases right if you want to interact with the machine no

need to become a programmer right just consider I want to perform a money

transaction from the ATM is it necessary to become a C programmer is it necessary

to become a Java programmer is it necessary to become a dotnet programmer

no not required right so not required simply in some of the cases as an end

user also you can communicate with the machine how that is possible see so I am

NOT the programmer but I want to interact with the machine to perform a

particular task so what we should do see here suppose so this person is a

programmer consider programmer so in this world along with the programmer one

more person is present the person is called end-user our client we are always

working for our clients only we are always working for end-users only we are

developing applications for end-users only here programmers provides

interfaces in her face sir what is interface just consider it's an

application ATM application only simple definition of interface we know

operating system is an interface right that is just working like a mediator

between the programmer when end-user and as well

as a background application interface means without having the background

details we can perform our tasks see just consider end user and user end user

want to perform one ATM transaction so can communicate can communicate using

interfaces how whenever end user enters into this ATM Center on the screen it

will give one message so what is it mrs. choose one language and here it is a

number of options it will give English Lu Hindi options it will give so for

example end user understands English end user click on English then all the

instructions will come in English language only so what is happening in

the background is not required for the end user nothing but whenever the end

user enter their pin number right our end user when ever enters how much

amount they want to withdraw how it is communicating with the server machine

how it is communicating with a server machine how it is communicating with the

database machine that is not required to the end user what is happening in the

background is not required for the end user for example so we are driving a car

you just want to increase the speed of the car we will accelerate generally so

whenever we accelerate and accelerate the speed will increase or ematic aliy

but what is happening in the background we don't know and of course that is not

required for the driver this speed is increasing or not that's it if speed is

not in using properly so then directly so we

are communicating with another person so who is called a mechanic so here suppose

if end-user trying to perform the transaction from the ATM if the

transaction is successful so then the end-user leave the ATM center with the

money for any reason if transaction has failed then end-user directly contact

the bank management and the bank management contact programmer because

programmer providing interface programmer providing interface so here

as a programmer we are not communicating with the machines just we are developing

applications nothing but we are providing interfaces by which every end

user can easily interact with the machine so that is our motto right so

this is about what is language what is computer language what is the need of

computer language so finally the main purpose of computer language is

developing applications by which end-users communicate with the machines
